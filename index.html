<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">My Role for this project was the Artist/Designer. I was able to create the assets, such as the stone bricks, characters, enemies. My producer and programmer, Brian Russler, made the base oft he design for the game, but I gave my opinion and decided to tweak some aspects of the game platforms.

When observing the players interact with my game, at first they seemed to be enjoying it. They were able to understand the mechanics of the game really well. One was able to find a small glitch within the jumping function of the character that made the character add an extra jump to the first one. Soon the players started to get a little frustrated when encountering enemies as well as acknowledging their health bar. The movement with the character seemed to be too fast to control, thus leading to the player having the character die. Even with the players being frustrated they seemed to enjoy and appreciate the game's challenge with the movement.

When asked how the player felt about the intensity of the jump and whether it should be decreased, they believed to decrease the intensity so the character doesn't seem too fast paced. When also asking about the background the players believed that the background design is fine the way it is, that way players can focus more on the gameplay aspect and the simplicity of the background allows the player to do so.

With the feedback given from the players that participated in playing my game, I would like to discuss with my partner tweaking the jump function and movement speed to be less intense for the player to move with more limitations. I would also like to possibly find time to incorporate another aspect into the background such as a mediaval castle or a dark forest. I will take all the feedback that the players made for my game and take it into consideration for the next process.
